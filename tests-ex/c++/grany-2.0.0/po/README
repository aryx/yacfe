Grany i18n
----------

We use GNU gettext. Please read ../README.internationalization for infos on the
user's point of view.

Now, if you want to add support for another language, keep reading on.


1. Once you've successfully made up Grany, a file grany.pot will handle all the
  english strings.


2. Let's suppose you want to write the italian translation, then copy grany.pot
  to it.po


3. Spend some time to make the translations!
  It's very easy. For each `msgid "<string-to-translate>"' you have to fill the next
   `msgstr ""' with the translation.
  For example:

	msgid " Close "
	msgstr ""

  Will become:

	msgid " Close "
	msgstr " Chiudi "

  (as long as I copied from gtk+ italian potfile correctly!)


4. Got to .. directory, hack `configure.in' adding `it' in ALL_LINGUAS.


5. Run `autoconf', `./configure', `make' and `make install'.



x. If you hacked Grany and added some strings, you will want to keep the valuable
  translations already done.
  Easy.
  Run `make' from the top grany directory to get the new grany.pot
  Just use `tupdate' to merge like this:
	tupdate grany.pot it.po > it.po.new

y. There are some bugs in `make dist' which makes it fail when there is an accentued
  french letter at the end of the string just before the ". Maybe it will fail also
  for other languages special characters, be careful.
