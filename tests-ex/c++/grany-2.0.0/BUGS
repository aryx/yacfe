*** A COMMON PROBLEM is to have `virtual memory exhausted'.
In such a case consider removing the optimizing flag, `-O'.

-> Compiler problems

1.
Apparently if you've got a SPARC Solaris 2.x and EGCS 1.1.1 there is a
`virtual memory exhausted' bug in the compiler. Please upgrade your compiler.


2.
Apparently a bug in EGCS, but with the -O2 option you can get `virtual memory
exhausted' on i386 hosts easily, especially when using GUIs.
They don't say how to prevent from it. So I chose to setup default CXX flags
to `-O' and not `-O2' for the whole application, shamelessly adding `-O2' by
hand for the engine makefile.


3.
Apparently a bug in EGCS 1.1.2 (because it's ok with GCC-2.95), when compiling there
is a strange warning message:

Automate.cpp: In method `class Particule * Automate::getParticuleByNumber(int) const':
Automate.cpp:360: warning: `const class Particule * this' might be used uninitialized in this function

If you look at the code you will find it strange, like me. (I hope)

(and, last but not least, no need to tell you that for the same version of the compiler,
it happens on i686 but not on sparc.)



-> flex++/bison++

1.
If you use flex++-2.3.8-6 to re-generate the headers, there is a bug which appears while
compiling the *Compiler.cpp (actually, it's a lack of some #define related to the fstream)

It works ok with flex++-2.3.8-7
