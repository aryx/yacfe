#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of word surrounded
# by quotes) that should identify the project. 

PROJECT_NAME         =

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER       =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY     =

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# The default language is English, other supported languages are: Dutch

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated
# by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank NO is used.

QUIET                = NO

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are
# generated by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank
# NO is used.

WARNINGS             = YES

# The DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index at
# top of each page. A value of NO (the default) enables the index and the
# value YES disables it.

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES all classes and functions will be
# included in the documentation, even if no documentation was available.

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class
# will be included in the documentation.

# undocumented classes.

# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc).
# Set to NO to disable this.

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation
# that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set 
# to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded.
# Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.

INTERNAL_DOCS        = NO

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description.

# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF         = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES Doxygen will prepend the full
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES      = NO

STRIP_FROM_PATH      =

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will

# super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS       = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO (the default) then Doxygen
# will only generate file names in lower case letters. If set to

# supports case sensitive file names.

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the

# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO.
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE            = NO

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should

# input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter program writes

# save some trees in general.
