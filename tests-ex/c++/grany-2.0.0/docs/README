Handwritten doc:
----------------

docs/BASICS
	I've written it quickly to help new users to `play'
	around with Grany.

docs/CUSTOMIZATION
	To help you obtain your own wonderful grany.


Ok, not much doc... I hope Dr. Dominique Deserable to write down a summup
of his theory I could add here.



Autogenerated doc:
------------------

At that time, the status of the documentation is:

*) engine:
	nice documentation done, but in french because for our University.
	no plan to translate it (if you want you can do it...)

*) interface:
	some documentation, in english.
	plan to upgrade to a better documentation.

*) rest:
	no doc. no plan.


If you enable the documentation, the engine-only documentation will be generated
in moteur/doxygen, the interface-only documentation in interface/doxygen, and
the whole documentation, in docs/developper
