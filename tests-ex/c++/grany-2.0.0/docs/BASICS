Here are basics to `play' with Grany if you're not a granular physicist,
or if you're not familiar with Dr. Dominique Deserable's theory.


To begin with : the `simulation' file
-------------------------------------

1. We will simulate the behavior of granular matter. For example,
  how cereals will go out of a silo.

2. We will use an hexagonal surface. Therefore our cells will have six
  neighbours. Arbitrary, it will be: north, south, north-east, north-west,
  south-east, and south-west.

3. Each cell will process its own request according to probabilities of
  requests.

4. The only move allowed is exchange, and two cells will exchange their
  positions if their requests fit. For example if a cell wants to go
  south, it will be able to go south if the south's cell wants to go
  north.

5. Then you're ready to open a `simulation' file for the main window.
  Use `file|open', follow `files|simulations' and choose
  `sand-water.simul'. It's a filled silo. Click on `play' and see how
  the sand will move south and the water north.


To continue using the marvellous software : the `scene' file
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Now let's create your own simulation.

2. A simulation file is static and all the cells are predefined. Let's use a
  `scene' file which has all the info but is still in the vectorial world.

3. Use `file|new' from the main window. You'll be requested a scene file.
  Use the browse button, follow `files|scenes' and choose `sand-water.scene'.

4. Now for example setup the network size to `100'. Click ok. (it will take
  a while for processing...)

5. In the main window a more precise silo should appear. If you play the
  simulation you will see that it's slower than before because there are much
  more cells in the simulation


Now you want more. Ok. Let's edit the `scene' file.
---------------------------------------------------

1. From the main window, choose `tools|scene editor'.

2. Use `file|open', follow `files|scenes' and choose again `sand-water.scene'.

3. Now you can see the vectorial scene displayed in the scene editor:
	notebook page #1 is the borders of the scene.
	notebook page #2 is all the `phases' defined. Phases are just our
		abstraction to define a kind of matter.
	notebook page #3 is the borders + the zonings of the phases.
	notebook page #4 is the borders + the zonings + the colorations.

4. In each notebook page you can edit and modify the scene. Try it !

5. When you're finished you can save up the file and use it as the scene of
  a new simulation.
