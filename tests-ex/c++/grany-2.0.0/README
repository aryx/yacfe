	By compiling and running Grany3, you implicitly accept this
	licence. Please read COPYING for more info.


[ Needs ]

	gnu make, gcc >= 2.95, libstdc++ v3 or superior (generally with
        gcc-2.96 or superior, maybe with 2.95), gtk+ >= 1.2.6, gtkmm >=
        1.2.0


[ Install ]

	Grany will **NOT** compile with gcc 2.7.x or gcc 2.8.x having
	libg++.

	Please read INSTALL for basic installation procedure.

	Rapid dependencies:
	 	GNU make
		A good compiler. Preferably GNU gcc 2.95 or better.
		glib 1.2.3 or better.
		gtk+ 1.2.3 or better.
		gtkmm 1.2 or better.

	With this it should be enough. Anyway `./configure' will warn you.

	Not necessary but can be useful for hacking Grany3:
		flex++ and bison++
		GNU gettext
		GNU automake/autoconf

	To make the docs, invoke `./configure' with `--enable-docs'.
	We used Doxygen, and it will generate html + latex + man
	documentation.

	Grany supports customization, please read docs/CUSTOMIZATION


	And - no!, GTK does not mean `The Grany ToolKit', but right `The
	Gimp ToolKit'.

	(usual Solaris 2.x gcc 2.8.0 will *NOT* work because of lack of
	iostream)

	(gcc 2.8.1 with libg++ will *NOT* work because of bad STL)

	Initial demo version: none :)


[ Using ]

	Well if you're not a granular physicist please read docs/BASICS


[ Hacking ]

	We're sorry but for our University we had to write code and
	documentation in french.

	However, I felt that this program could be a good example of GTK--
	so I took the time to translate everything in the interface to
	english - that means both identifiers and comments are now in
	english.

	Sorry, but for the rest of the code (the engine, the files, etc),
	all is still in french...


[ Documentation ]

	Please have a look at docs/README for info about documentation.


[ Shameless autosatisfaction ]

	Lines of code processed by our brains:

		engine:	      9197
		interface:   13217
		console:       504
		figures:      1450
		hexagonal:    9058
		files:	      2373

	That is 35799 lines of pure code, not counting the scripts,
	the test code, the generated parsers/compilers.
