We tried to produce the best OO conception possible for Grany - in that
way we put an impassable barrier between the GUI and the rest of the
program, including the engine, file handling, and so on.

That's why it was so easy to produce a console-only binary, `granyconsole'.

In order to show how we can powerfully use this small tool, we wrote
an example Perl script, `turning_scene', which shows how one can pipe
several calls to granyconsole, rotating ponderations of the phases to obtain
a `turning' scene.
