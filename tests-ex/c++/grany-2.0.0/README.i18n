Grany Internationalization
--------------------------

For current version, supported languages include:

+) english (default language)
+) french


Grany can take advantage of a system made by GNU (http://www.gnu.org)
which provides dynamic language localization.

To the user point of view: (example, french language)
- if you have a sh-like shell, use: export LANGUAGE=fr
- if you have a csh-like shell, use: setenv LANGUAGE fr

Then Grany will talk french, and if Gtk has been properly installed, even
the file selection dialogs will be in french.

WARNING: if LC_ALL is set for example to en_US it will override LANGUAGE.
Use `unsetenv LC_ALL'.
WARNING: if it does not work yet try setting also LANG to `fr'.

To the developper point of view: if you want to add support for another
language, please read po/README and drop me a message !
