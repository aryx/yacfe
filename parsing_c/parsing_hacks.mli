open Common 

(* Try detect some cpp idioms so can parse as is files by adjusting or
 * commenting some tokens. Parsing hack style. Sometime use indentation info,
 * Sometimes do some kind of lalr(k) by finding patterns. Often try to
 * work on better token representation, like ifdef-paren-ized, brace-ized,
 * paren-ized, so can do easier pattern matching to more easily match
 * complex cpp idiom pattern. Also try to get context info such as
 * whether the token is in a initializer as some common patterns have different
 * use depending on context.
 * 
 * 
 * Example of cpp idioms:
 *  - if 0 for commenting stuff (not always code, sometimes just real comments)
 *  - ifdef old version
 *  - ifdef funheader
 *  - ifdef statements, ifdef expression, ifdef-mid
 *  - macro toplevel (with or without ptvirg)
 *  - macro foreach
 *  - macro higher order
 *  - macro declare
 *  - macro debug
 *  - macro no ptvirg
 *  - macro string, and macro function string taking param and ##
 *  - macro attribute
 * Cf the TMacroXxx in parser_c.mly and MacroXxx in ast_c.ml
 * 
 * Also try infer typedef.
 * 
 * Also do other stuff involving cpp like expanding some macros, 
 * or try parse well define body by finding the end of define virtual 
 * end-of-line token.
