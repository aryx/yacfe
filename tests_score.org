* parsing C++

** firefox

*** C part: (-parse_c)
nb files = 1460
nb lines (+ 991205 61358)

 90%
 94% (after simple (1h work) adjust of standard.h and lexer_c.mll)
 95.5%  with -filter_define_error (following numbers also use that now)

*** C++ part: (-parse_c++)
nb files = 3967
nb lines =  (+ 384579 1415548)

last: 

cf yacfe-notes for the initial logging of scores while gradually
improving the parser.



*** H part (parse_h++)
day4: firefox 2(but perhaps many C headers)
 66%   after having 91% on cpp and implemented the class support
 68%   misc_macro
 70%   misc_macro 
 71%   

day5: firefox 3
 59%  :(((
 62%
 65%

day6:
 79% firefox 2
 74% firefox 3

*** H and C++ (parse_ch++)

 90%

** mysql

 85% after having a 90% for firefox, just text mysql (without adding anything)
 87%

* parsing C

** linux 

99.1% for .h and .c


* parsing Java

Almost 100% each time ... too easy :)


* parsing -dir tests/

** sans -add_typedef_root 

NB total files = 2212; perfect = 1810; pbs = 402; timeout = 0; =========> 81%
nb good = 2903297,  nb bad = 151164    =========> 95%


** avec -add_typedef_root,  moins bon :(

NB total files = 2212; perfect = 1802; pbs = 410; timeout = 0; =========> 81%
nb good = 2899792,  nb bad = 154669    =========> 94%


** avec -ifdef_to_if ? avec  -retry_ifdef ?
